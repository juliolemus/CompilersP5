Explanation:

For the symbol table, I used the structs and maps provided to create the actual table with all the offset, sizes, and other information fields assigned and maintained with their appropriate values.
The visitor pattern allowed us to set values such as currentlocaoffset at the appropriate time during the visitation.

For the codegeneration part, I implemented the operations needed such as addition, subtraction, division and others such as negation. I used x86 operations such as push and pop to acces data from the stack and also to put back data onto the stack for future use.
